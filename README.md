# SQL_Data_Analysis_Previous_Work

In this repository, I added some examples of SQL queries completed at a previous role (with some changes to preserve proprietary data). The main goal of this project was to understand, more granularly, the health of each group as well as members' lifecycle and preferences. In other words, an exploratory data analysis to maximize data set insights, reveal underlying patterns and structure, extract important information, and detect any internal anomalies that could affect multiple stakeholders.

After the initial querying, I created an in-depth dashboard directly in PopSQL (not pictured due to proprietary rights) to obtain initial (and recurring) insights. After, I focused on analyzing specific sections of the data to understand potential patterns.
