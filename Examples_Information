# SQL_Previous_Work_Examples

In this repository, I added some examples of SQL queries completed at a previous role. The main goal of this project was to understand, more granularly, the health of each group as well as members' lifecycle and preferences. 

Most of these queries focused on data gathering and analysis, incluing a complete "Group Health" dashboard created directly in PopSQL.
